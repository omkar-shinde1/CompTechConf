            <p align="justify"><strong>Dr. Ilenia Farina </strong> is an Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Technology, Department of Engineering - University Parthenope of Naples, Research Unit Parthenope - INSTM - National Interuniversity, Italy. </br>
            She received her Ph.D. in  “Energy Science and Engineering” and a Master Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Naples Parthenope, defending a master thesis titled “Mechanical properties and manufacturing process of innovative sustainable cementitious materials”. She completed also a Master in “Materials Science and Engineering” at the University of Sheffield (UK), defending a thesis titled “Plasma treatments of polymers for increased adhesion in composite materials”. She graduated in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Salerno, submitting a final project titled: “Mechanical properties and manufacturing process of innovative sustainable cementitious materials”. </br>

              In 2012, she was member the group submitting the project “New Materials and Techniques for Sustainable Engineering” in the Start Cup Campania. This project has been awarded third prize in the Business Plan Competition.</br>
                Ilenia’s research interests deal with the development of innovative materials for sustainable constructions. She has conducted experimental studies to demonstrate the employability of plastic fibres obtained from waste plastic as dispersed reinforcement in cementitious materials. Furthermore, she has also developed new fibre geometries, with the aim of enhancing the thermo-mechanical performance of fibre reinforced concrete and mortars. Her current research activity focus on the development of new fiber-reinforced geopolymers using conventional raw materials as well as inorganic waste materials.</br>
                She is author of several scientific papers published in international peer-reviewed journal and international conference proceedings.
