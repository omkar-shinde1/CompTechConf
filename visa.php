        <h3 style="color:#f4cb1e;"> Invitation Letter:</h3>
        <p>
         A Letter of Invitation is a proof for conference registration and attendance application. It will be stated in English and may help with your visa application. However, it does not guarantee you a visa. Invitation letters will only be issued once your registration and payment have been confirmed. And it will be sent by e-mail. For those who require a visa, please note that the Organizing Committee has no control over the visa application process, or the decision of the visa adjudicator in the embassy or consulate. The conference cannot be responsible for actual visa issuances. The process length varies from individuals, you're strongly advised to start your application as soon as you can.Should your application be denied, we cannot change the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor will we engage in discussion or correspondence with the Embassy on behalf of the applicant.
